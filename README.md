# face-recognition-based-attendance-system-Flask-app

This project is an attendance system that utilizes a face recognition model based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Machine Learning algorithm and is built using the Flask framework in Python. The system provides a user-friendly interface with two main features: "add new member" and "attendance". The "add new member" feature allows users to register new individuals into the system by capturing their facial data, while the "attendance" feature enables the system to recognize registered faces and mark their attendance automatically. This solution aims to streamline the attendance process, making it more efficient and accurate.
